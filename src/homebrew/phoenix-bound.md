### Disadvantages

* If the Young Phoenix is reduced to 0 health, it dissipates. It reforms in its object in 2d6 + 2 days and you are debilitated for the same numbers of days. If you are debilitated in this manner all your pools must be reduced to zero to die.
* Choose 2:
  * People find you unnerving. All tasks relating to pleasant social interaction are hindered. (Glowing object when inside, or glowing phoenix outside)
  * When the Young Phoenix is neither mentally connected or in close proximity, all Intellect and Speed tasks are hindered. (you rely on the phoenix)
  * You tend to fixate on the details, making you somewhat oblivious to whatâ€™s going on around you. Any task to hear or notice dangers around you is hindered. (the phoenix wants to know everything, do everything)
  * When you see something interesting, you hesitate as you take in all the details. Initiative actions (to determine who goes first in combat) are hindered. (the phoenix wants to know everything, do everything)

where RS = the Relationship score with the bearer.  A platonic score is positive and a rivalry score is negative.  Cannot be both platonic and a rival.

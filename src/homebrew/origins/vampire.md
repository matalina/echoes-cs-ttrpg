# Vampire

## Ability
* Drain Creature

## Disadvantages

* **You Must Feed:** If you fail to drain a creature once per session your might and speed pools are decreased by 1 until you use drain creature to restore one lost pool per action.  ie: failure to use it once per session would require 3 the next session to regain all your pools back and not take another hit.  The affects are cumulative

# Chevalier

A vampires bound human servant

## Ability

* Calm

## Disadvantages

* Being so receptive to othersâ€™ thoughts and moods makes you vulnerable to anything that attacks your mind. Intellect defense rolls are hindered.

## Background and Story

**Age:** 818 (looks 21)

When Ryan was 16 he was taken as the human servant to one of the most powerful vampires of that time.  She gave birth to a son shortly there after thanks to a magical ceremony.  Ryan and her son grew close over the years and when Ant started showing signs of Drifting he bound himself to the growing vampire.

Over the years Ryan and Ant's friendship grew and when Ant asked his mother to join Rift Hunters International, Ryan asked for his release and joined Ant on his hunt for self.

Ant did not take Ryan as his human servant (yet) and Ryan is now aging. It has been 5 years and he still waits for Ant to claim his soul in the vampiric rites.

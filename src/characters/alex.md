## Background and Story

**Age:** 25

Alex is a dream walker who visits Arcadis and writes stories about those dreams and sells them for profit.

Alex was born to Thomas Alexander Brizo and Grace Harper-Brizo.

Alex has always had an active imagination and has consistently drifted in and out of his own worlds for nearly as long as he can remember.  It feels as though his dreams and stories are real, and that there is some meaning behind them. Sometimes it's difficult to leave the dream world behind and return to his own reality.

In college Alex studied investigative forensics as well as minored in creative writing.  He has been writing a series of books called "Plane Hunters" since he was a kid, the earlier versions never saw the light of day, but the last three titles have been a big hit.

The night before the story begins Alex sent his latest work into the cloud for safe keeping while he began his research on his next big project.  He curled up in bed with his 'falling asleep book' -- a dry and dull exposition on the treatise of man, wearing a pair of blue boxer briefs he did not expect to wake up in another world wearing the same thing he went to bed in.

> Brizo means to slumber.  Brizo is a little-known Greek goddess of dreams and oceans. Her name is derived from the Greek “brizein” (to fall asleep), chosen because she delivered prophecies to her worshippers while they slept.

# Nox Luxignis

## Player Intrusions

* Perfect Setup
* Old Friend
* Weapon Break

## Disadvantages

* If the Young Phoenix is reduced to 0 health, it dissipates. It reforms in its object in 2d6 + 2 days and you are debilitated for the same numbers of days. If you are debilitated in this manner all your pools must be reduced to zero to die.

## Background and Story

**Age:** 23

Dorian and Marco were approached by a Collector and regurgitated a three day old baby still alive and wrapped his tentacle around Marco's neck and spoke through him.  He placed the metallic phoenix feather on the baby's chest. "They will die without each other."

Since Nox's arrival in Arcanis he has been visited by an Echo of a boy.  Dorian and Marco invite the boy to join them even though they couldn't talk to him.  Nox could hear him but his parents don't.

Nox and the Young Phoenix grew up together and shared one anothers powers in a symobotic relationship.  And for some reason unknown to most of the world Nox never drifted uncontrollably despite having no anchor.

On the night the story starts Nox is called to duty as are all DEHI agents to tend to the influx of manifesting echoes.

### Character Arcs

1. Solve a Mystery - What happened to bring all the manifestations into being at one time.

## Appearance

**Hair:** Chestnut brown hair with tips dyed red (or other colors of his choosing)<br/>
**Eyes:** Deep Chocolate brown<br/>
**Height:** 6'0"<br/>
**Build:** well defined muscular build that requires a lot of work to maintain<br/>

He has one large tattoo starting mid thigh the tail feathers of a red/orange phoenix flow up his thigh, the wings wrap around at his hip bone, some of the ink would land in the pubic hair region but Nox is a meticulous groomer so perfectly kept and nothing marring the ink, the head of the bird points towards his belly button, and then it turns into a bunch of red/orange tribal tattoo solid shapes, that gradually darken and turn to black tribal tattoos up his chest and shoulder and as they turn around his shoulder they start to lighten until they are nothing but outlines. None of the ink can be seen if he's wearing a buttoned up marine uniform shirt, with long sleeves, stops about 2-3 inches above his wrist. the edge of the phoenix peak out at the hem of basketball shorts, and a few wisps of black at the neck when he wears a t-shirt, and then most of the sleeve if he's wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt/tank top

Nox's default clothing appearance is Shift #0 jeans, a t-shirt, a gray hoodie and a pair of canvas chucks.

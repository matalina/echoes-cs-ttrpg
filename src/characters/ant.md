## Background and Story

**Age:** 751 (looks 25)

For hundreds of years Anthony Giovanni lived in the shadow of his mother.  Her tight control on the vampires of the night left the world to fear him because of her viciousness.

Ant bound himself to her human servant for hundreds of years before they joined the Rift Hunters International so that Ant could make a name for himself outside of his mother's name.

Ant was born a vampire.  The bloodlust wasn't new to him, but the RHI saw many of their own tip into the scales of destruction.

But Ant's true story doesn't really begin until the night the planes aligned pulling echoes from all over into the wrong planes.  Ant's mother was one such unlucky creature pulled into another world.  Ant and Ryan went after her.

His skin has a natural sun kissed color despite lack of sun exposure. He has retractable fangs .When Ant feeds his eyes turn red. He can usually control it, but when he is particularly hungry he is not always capable of hiding his eyes.

Ant typically wears all black - black jeans, with a black t-shirt and a black leather jacket and combat boots as it helps hide in the shadows better. He also carries a sword at his left hip and a pair of blasters at the small of his back.
